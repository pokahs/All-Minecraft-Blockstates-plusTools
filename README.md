# MC Blockstates
If you've ever played mc, you prob know all blocks are not the same. hopefully.
However, if your really observative, you might have realized not all instances of one block is the same either. For example:

A brick stair will come in many ways. It can face different directions, be upside down, or be a corner version. We call these different states
of what a block can be *blockstates*.

Now, many blocks don't have any blockstates, or *tags* as you might also say. Common blocks like planks or cobblestone simply have no different
versions of themselves. However you place a cobblestone block, it will always be a cobble block. :/

Now, a lot of blocks' blockstates are stored in the mc assests folder. However, upon checking many of them, the json for many blocks show no tags. However, in game, these blocks do actually have tags, so idk wtf happened or how minecraft really stores blockstate data.

Anyway, I needed like a good list of all the blockstate info, and with all these gaps in the assets, I went and made my own. So uh hf, theres a raw block_data.json file that just has everything though there also some organized files. Theres a good chance there are errors in the data, so lemme know if you spot anything.

# MC Tools

Also working on some tools that will prob use blockstates. Rly just for personal use, not anything big.
